# Inkplain app
A website I created with Vue and Node for creating and viewing digitally handwritten videos. Stores videos as a series of input events, rather than raster frames. When efficiently encoded, this allows for a drastic reduction in 'video' size. It is only suitable for handwritten recorded presentations potentially backed by slides, however this is a restriction often suitable in educational environments.

Programmed as part of a High School course in 2019 that required we create some piece of software. Being in my final year of high school, a website to store recordings of handwritten notes seemed useful.
